openssl-crypt -- Simple inline encryption for Emacs via OpenSSL

I wanted to be able to encrypt just *parts* of files with AES, for
instance, instead of GnuPG. So, voila!

Why? For a long time, I used KeepassX to store my mountains of
passwords, so I don't have to click the Link of Shame ("I forgot my
password") every time I visit a site after more than two weeks away
from it. KeepassX is great, except it uses a binary database. I keep
all my stuff under source control, so plain text is a lot more
convenient. (Automatic merging? Delicious.)

So, instead of KeepassX, I now store all my passwords in an org file,
and use this code to only encrypt the sensitive bits.

I've only tested this in Emacs 24. It's hopefully obvious that you
also need to have the openssl command-line utility installed for this
to work.
