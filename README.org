openssl-crypt -- Simple inline encryption for emacs via OpenSSL

I wanted to be able to encrypt just *parts* of files, and read them
without having to use GPG. So, voila! Symmetric encryption for emacs,
via openssl.

Why? For a long time, I used KeepassX to store my mountains of
passwords, so I don't have to click the Link of Shame ("I forgot my
password") every time I visit a site after more than two weeks away
from it. KeepassX is great, except it uses a binary database. I keep
all my stuff under source control, so plain text is a lot more
convenient. (Automatic merging? Delicious.)

So, instead of KeepassX, I now store all my passwords in an org file,
and use this code to only encrypt the sensitive bits.
